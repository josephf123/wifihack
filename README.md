# wifihack

This is a simple script made for a university project. The device in which this script runs is a raspberry
pi connected to a GPS module.

The script essentially gets wifi data from all the access points and clients nearby and combines this
information with the GPS data. It then logs this information into a csv file which can later be used
to analyse information about specific areas, mainly used as a wardriving tool.
